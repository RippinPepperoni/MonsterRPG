# MonsterRPG
 
This is just a prototype monster summoner RPG created as a learning exercise. 
It is not at a state where you can compile and play it outside of the editor, more work would need to be done to setup multi-scene support.
Omitted sprites and other art assets since I would like to keep them for future projects.
